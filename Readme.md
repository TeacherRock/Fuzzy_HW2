# Fuzzy HW2 
**Part I :** Perform the feature (attribute) extraction, clustering, and classification to make a correct diagnostic, where testing dada is the training data.  
1. **fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm**
    refer : main_fuzzy_c_means.py
2. **fuzzy k-nearest neighbor approach**
    refer : main_fuzzy_knn.py
3. **nearest neighbor approach**
    refer : main_knn.py

**Part II :** Perform the feature (attribute) extraction, clustering, and classification. For classification problem, please perform the leave-one-out method. 
1. **fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm**
    refer : main_fuzzy_c_means_leave_one_out.py
2. **fuzzy k-nearest neighbor approach**
    refer : main_fuzzy_knn_leave_one_out.py
3. **nearest neighbor approach**
    refer : main_knn_leave_one_out.py

Each python file perform the method with/without feature normalization
Leave-one-out versions use the best combination of features from the orginal version
